# Comparative Evaluation of Biomedical and General Large Language Models for Radiology Report Generation in Resource-Constrained Settings
This repository contains the implementation, and configuration files used in our study on "Comparative Evaluation of Biomedical and General Large Language Models for Radiology Report Generation in Resource-Constrained Settings", based on the R2GenGPT framework and QLoRA 4-bit double quantization for a comparative evaluation of general-purpose and biomedical large language models.
